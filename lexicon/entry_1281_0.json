The ancient worship of Israel was conducted on these high places. In the times of Samuel and David they ascended to them, descended from them, and offered sacrifices on them, 1Sa 9:12-25, 1Sa 10:5, 1Sa 10:13 ([[הבמה]] for [[הביתה]] We Dr). The custom continued in the reign of Solomon, but Gibeon was [[הבמה]] [[הגדולה]] 1Ki 3:2-4 cf. 1Ch 16:39, 1Ch 21:29, 2Ch 1:3, 2Ch 1:13.

The worship of Yahweh on high places continued in Judah until the exile 1Ki 22:44, 2Ki 15:35; the sanctity code predicts that Yahweh will destroy them Le 26:30; they were regarded as the reason for the rejection of Shiloh Ps 78:58.
