The reading here became early a subject of dispute, and MSS. and edd. vary accordingly. Some follow the school of Nehardea, and read [[הַל יְהוָֹה]]; others (so Norzi) follow the school of Sora, and read [[הַ לְיהוָֹה]]; others (so Hahn) have [[הַלְיהוָֹה]]. Were [[הַל]] original, it would be an interrog. part. = Ar. halo, for which elsewhere [[הֲ]] is always found. The other punctuations would also each be highly irregular. The true reading is undoubtedly [[הֲלַיהוָֹה]] ([[הַלְיַהְוֶה]]). Cf. De Rossi:Var. Lect. ad loc.; and on the possible origin of the anomaly, Gei:J&#252;d.
