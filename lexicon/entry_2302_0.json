(The [[א]] is not orthographic merely, but radical, being written on Moab. and Ph. inscriptions, though dropped in some of the later dialects. [In Heb. only Je 29:23 Kt, and in the pr. n.

(often) [[הא]]; Aram. of Zinjirli [[הא]], once [[הו]] (DHM:Inschr. von Sendschirli 55); Targum [[הוּא]], [[הִיא]] Syr. huw, hiy; Ar. huwa, hiya (for h&#363;&#8217;a, h&#299;&#8217;a, W:SG 104); Eth. w0tu: y0ty: we&#8217;&#277; t&#363;, ye&#8217;&#277; t&#299;; perh. also As. &#353;&#251;, &#353;&#238;, himself, herself suff. &#353;u, &#353;i, cf. demonstr. &#353;uatu, &#353;iati (v. Kraetzschmar:BAS. i. 383 &#38; reff., W:SG 98, 105 Dl:&#167; 55b, 57). In the Pent., [[הוא]] is of common gender, the fem. form [[הִיא]] occurring only 11 times, viz. Ge 14:2, Ge 20:5, Ge 38:25 (v. Mass. here), Le 11:39, Le 13:10, Le 13:21, Le 16:31, Le 20:17, Le 21:9, Nu 5:13, Nu 5:14. The punctuators, however, sought to assimilate the usage of the Pent. to that of the rest of the OT, and accordingly wherever [[הוא]] was construed as a fem. pointed it [[הִוא]] (as a Qr&#234; perpetuum). Outside the Pent. the same Qr&#234; occurs 1Ki 17:15, Is 30:33, Job 31:11 a&#8212;prob. for the sake of removing gramm. anomalies: five instances of the converse change, viz. of [[היא]] to be read as [[הוּא]], occur for a similar reason, 1Ki 17:15 ([[וַתּאׁכַל הוּא־וׇהִיא]] to be read as [[וַתּאׁכַל הִיא־וׇהוּא]], on account of the fem. verb) Ps 73:16, Job 31:11 b ([[כי הוא זמה והיא עָוֹן]] [[פלילים]] to be read as [[כי היא זמה והוא עון פלילים]]), Ec 5:8, 1Ch 29:16. The origin of the peculiarity in the Pent. is uncertain. It can hardly be a real archaism : for the fact that arab., Aram., &#38; Eth. have distinct forms for masc. &#38; fem. shews that both must have formed part of the original Semitic stock, and consequently of Hebrew as well, from its earliest existence as an independent language. Nor is the peculiarity confined to the Pent.: in the MS. of the Later Prophets, of A.D. 916, now at S. Petersburg, published in facsimile by Strack (1876), the fem. occurs written [[הוא]] (see the passages cited in the Adnotationes Criticae, p. 026). In Ph. both masc. and fem. are alike written [[הא]] (CIS i. 1:9 [[מלך חדק הא]], l.:13 [[מלאכת הא]], 3:10 [[אדם הא]], l.:11 [[ממלכת הא]], 93:2, 94:2), though naturally this would be read as hu&#8217; or hi&#8217; as occasion required. Hence, as LXX shews that in the older Heb. MSS. the scriptio plena was not yet generally introduced, it is prob. that originally [[הא]] was written for both genders in Hebrew likewise, and that the epicene [[הוא]] in the Pent. originated at a comparatively late epoch in the transmission of the text&#8212;perh. in connexion with the assumption, which is partly borne out by facts (cf. De:ZKWL 1880, pp. 393&#8211;399), that in the older language fem. forms were more sparingly used than subsequently.)\r","content":"definition","show":"block"},{"title":"Def","body":"In usage [[הוּא]](f.
