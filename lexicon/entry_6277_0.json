Chr., near in date, gives the clue which is intrinsically prob.: [[לְ]] indicates, not assignment (nothing special in these PsalmPsalm to suggest it, and assignment of PsalmPsalm for such use a matter of course), but that these PsalmPsalm were taken by final editor from an older major Psalter known as the Director's Collection, cf. the still earlier collections known as [[דוד]]([[ל]]), [[אסף]]([[ל]]), [[בני קרח]]([[ל]]). The 55 PsalmPsalm with [[למנחח]] were taken 39 from Davidic, 9 from Korahite, and 5 from Asaphic Psalters; only 2 anonymous. Hb Hab 3 originally belonged to Director's Psalter. This and other Director's PsalmPsalm have musical directions in titles.

Intr. 123).\r","content":"definition","show":"block"}],"notes":"","etymology":[],"morphology":[]}
