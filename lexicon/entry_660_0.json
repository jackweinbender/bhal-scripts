With [[הֲ]] [[הֶאָנׁכִי]] &#134; Nu 11:12, Job 21:4. (As. an&#226;ku, Ph. &#38; Moab. [[אנך]]: not in Ar. Aram, Eth.; but ku appears as the affix of the 1 s. in the Eth. verb (e.g. waladku = Heb. [[יׇלַדְתִּי]]). [[אָנׁכִי]] and [[אֲנִי]] appear to be two parallel formations (both containing the element ani [cf. the sf. -niya, [[נִי]]-] or ana, &#38; one strengthened by the addition of the demonst. basis Ku [prob. akin to ko0 [[כָּא]], [[כּׂה]] here]: cf. Sta:&#167; 179 W:SG 95 f. 98&#8211;101), of which, in most of the Sem. languages, one prevailed to the exclusion of the other, but which in Heb. maintained their place side by side.) In some cases [[אני]] and [[אנכי]] appear capable of being used indiffer-ently; in others the choice seems to have been determined, partly by rhythmical considera-tions, partly by a growing preference for [[אֲנִי]] among later writers. Thus when appended to the verb for emph. (whether with or without [[גַּם]]) the lighter form [[אֲנִי]] is nearly always used ( Le 20:5, Le 26:24, Le 26:32, De 12:30, Ju Jdg 1:3, Jdg 8:23, 2Sa 12:28, 2Sa 17:15, 2Sa 18:2, 2Sa 18:22, Je 17:18, Je 21:5, Ez Eze 17:22, Job 13:2 +; cf. the cases Ge 27:34, 1Sa 25:24, 2Sa 19:1, 1Ki 1:26, Pr 23:15); on the contrary, in the emph. rhetorical style of Dt, [[אָנׁכִי]] is preferred (in the discourses, uniformly, exc. De 12:30, in acc. with usage just noted, &#38; De 29:5 in a standing expression; on De 32:48, De 32:51 (P) cf. infr.) In partic. phrases, also, usage prefers sts. [[אֶני]] sts. [[אָנכי]] thus there occurs [[חַי־אָנִי]] Nu 14:21 &#38; always, exc, De 32:40; ([[אָ֫נִי]]) [[אִתְּךָ אֲנִי]] (Je 1:9, Je 1:19, Je 30:11, Je 46:18, Is 43:2, Is 43:5); [[אֲנִי יהוה]] Ex 6:2, Ex 6:6, Ex 6:8 &#38; elsewh. in P, &#38; esp. freq. in H (Le 18:2, Le 18:4, Le 18:6 etc.) &#38; Ez, also Ge 15:7, Ge 28:13, De 29:5, Ju Jdg 6:10 +; ([[אנכי יהוה]] much less freq.; only JE &#38; proph. writers, &#134; Ex 20:2 = De 5:6, Ho 12:10, Ho 13:4, Ps 81:11, Ex 20:5 = De 5:9, Is 43:11, Is 44:24, Is 51:15, (Ex 4:11 is diff.); cf. Dr:JPh xi. 224 f.); [[אני אמרתי]] Is 38:10 (Hez.) Is 49:4, Je 5:4, Je 10:19 (Je 3:19 [[אנכי]]) Ru 4:4, Ps 30:7, Ps 31:23, Ps 41:5, Ps 82:6 +; [[ויאמר אָ֫נִי]] (in response to a qu.) Ge 27:24, Ju Jdg 13:11, 2Sa 20:17, 1Ki 13:14, 1Ki 18:8 ([[אנכי]] &#180;[[וי]] only 2Sa 2:20; on the contrary, with a predicate, [[אָנׁבִי]] is regularly employed, Ge 24:34, 1Sa 30:13, 2Sa 1:8 [[עֲמָלֵקִי אָנׁ֑בִי]] 2Sa 11:5, 2Sa 20:17, Is 6:5, Je 1:6, Jon 1:9); ([[הִנְנִי]]) [[וַאֲנִי הִנֵּה]] Ge 6:17, Ge 9:9, Ex 31:6, Nu 3:12 + (but [[הִנֵּה אָנׁכִי]] Ge 24:14, Ge 24:43, Ge 25:32, Ex 3:13, Ex 19:9 +; [[הִנֵּה אֲנִי]] is very uncommon; v. ib.:226). So far as the usage of partic. books is concerned, in the Pent. (exc. Dt) [[אֲנִי]] is used in P (incl. H) always (about 130 t.) exc. Ge 23:4 (cf. Ez below); in JE [[אנכי]] is preferred, though not exclusively (81:48). In S there are 50 instances of each form. Je has some 54 instances of [[אֶני]] 37 of [[אנכי]]. In later books the preponderance of [[אֲנִי]] is evident. Thus in Ez [[אני]] occurs 138 t., [[אנבי]] once Eze 36:28 (perh. a reminiscence of Je 11:4 b, Je 24:7, Je 30:22); in La Hg Ezr Est Ec [[אני]] 45 t., [[אנכי]] never; in Ch [[אני]] 30 t., [[אנכי]] once 1Ch 17:1 (from 2Sa 7:2); in Dn [[אני]] 23 t., [[אנכי]] once Da 10:11.
